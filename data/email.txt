A very special letter from Santa
Dear [NAME]
I was looking forward to bring joy and presents to all the people in the world this Christmas. But since I'm 200 years old and I did not renew my health insurance lately, I received a very nasty letter placing me in quarantine :(
Hence, I will need your help this year, to help me spread the joy. I know you are not the athlete you used to be, so I'll give you only one name from my list of good people:
You are now the Secret Santa of [RECIPIENT].
Now get your butt out of that couch, pack your backpack with some energy bars, do 20 push ups and let's go! I am counting on you to find a beautiful present for this nice person. And remember what old Santa always says:
Put all your heart into something and you can achieve anything!
Thank you so much for your help, you are a wonderful person.
With love
Santa
